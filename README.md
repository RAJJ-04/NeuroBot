# NeuroBot
This project focuses on building an AI-powered chatbot designed to offer emotional support and understanding to individuals facing anxiety, stress, and depression. By using a carefully curated dataset of real-life mental health conversations, the chatbot is trained to recognize emotional intent and respond with empathy and useful guidance.
